## Requirements

## Usage

- open https://www.fielmann.de/brillen/ in a browser, create the desired filters, and show results

```sh
deno task products
```

- note: can browse with Nushell
- note: beware of empty cells, throws error if row has empty cell for selected column
- note: price is for rim only, needs to add price for lenses (e.g. 17â‚¬ for basic lenses), website shows price with basic lenses
